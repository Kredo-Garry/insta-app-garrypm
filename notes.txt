 ---- USERS----
To deactivate a user, we will use "SoftDeletes"  in Laravel

- The "SoftDeletes" will add additional column in our users table (deleted_at) column
- The deleted_at column will contain the date and time that the user is soft deleted
- When the user is softdelete, the user will be hidden from the application, but the data will
  be retain in the database, which will be use for restore/or activating the user again.

  Middleware --> what is middleware?
  Answer: it is a mechanism for inspecting and filtering the HTTP traffic request.
  The Laravel provides "Auth middleware" to verify if the user is authenticated.

  Think of the middleware as an extra layer of protection, that examines the request going through the application.
  We have to create and use our own middleware, and we will call "AdminMiddleware"

  What is the purpose of our AdminMiddleware?
  -> is allow or deny access to the Admin Dashboard. Our basis for this is the role_id from the database. If the 
  role_id is 1, then the user can access the Admin Dashboard, if the role_id is 2, then the user cannot access the admin dashboard.

  Database Seeder (Seeding the database)
  
  -> The user cannot create post if the categories table is empty, therefore we have to seed (add) the database with data
  -> the seeder can create a default data into our database tables
